This is a proof of concept, basically what this will do is return an image of a graphed function given a string containing an equation
As for now this works with an express client, by placing the equation after the / in the link (http://localhost:3000/x**2+5*x-10 for example), 
it'll load an image of the graphed function

Installation
```bash
npm i graphing_calc
```
